# TODO-App

Here I have created a simple todo application using Expo CLI & React Native technologies. I am also utilizing AsyncStorage to store the tasks persistently, which allows the user to close the application without losing their data.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`or just `yarn`
3. Run the application: `npm start` or `yarn start`
